description: '"I wouldn''t advise you young ladies to take the boat out." Miss Elting
  instantly recalled the message from her brother. The telegram was in her pocket
  at that moment, "If you have any trouble, Dee Dickinson will see that you are protected,"
  read the message. It was Dee Dickinson who had spoken to her at that moment. Dee
  had made a distinctly unfavorable impression on Miss Elting, the guardian and companion
  of the Meadow-Brook girls.'
